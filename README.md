## Project Description

**Cycora** is a menstrual wellness and emotional support platform designed to help women track their cycle, predict upcoming phases, monitor symptoms and moods, and receive emotional support through a unique feature called *Inner Circle*.

It combines cycle tracking, AI-based predictions, emotional insights, and supportive friendships — all in a clean, elegant, privacy-focused experience.

---

## The Problem Statement

Menstrual health tracking apps focus mainly on physical cycle logging but overlook emotional well-being and social support.

Women often:
- Feel misunderstood during different cycle phases
- Lack emotional support from close friends
- Do not have personalized mood + symptom insights
- Worry about privacy when using health apps

There is a need for a safe, emotionally intelligent, and privacy-focused platform that connects cycle tracking with support.

## The Solution

Cycora solves this by:

- Providing accurate menstrual cycle prediction using user input
- Tracking moods, symptoms, and patterns
- Generating AI-powered insights
- Introducing **Inner Circle**, where up to 10 trusted friends can receive optional phase updates
- Encouraging empathy and emotional care
- Ensuring privacy-first architecture using secure authentication and database design

Cycora blends wellness, technology, and emotional intelligence.
